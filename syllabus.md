## About 🧐

DSC 80 serves as a bridge between lower-division and upper-division data
science courses. In DSC 80, students will gain proficiency with the data
science life cycle and learn many of the fundamental principles and techniques
of data science spanning algorithms, statistics, machine learning,
visualization, and data systems.

After DSC 80, students will be prepared for data science internships and
interviews, will have the tools to create their own data science portfolios,
and will have the maturity necessary to succeed in upper-division machine
learning and statistics courses.

**Prerequisites:** DSC 30 and DSC 40A.

## Getting Started 💻

The course website, [dsc80.com](https://dsc80.com), will contain links to all
course content. There are also a few things you'll need to do to get set up.

### Websites

You'll need to make accounts on the following sites:

- **Ed:** We’ll be using Ed as our course message and discussion board. More
  details are in the [Communication](#communication-) section below. If you
  didn’t already get an invitation to our Ed course, [sign up
  here](https://edstem.org/us/join/NfMDxv).

- **Gradescope:** You’ll submit all assignments and exams to
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/625393). This is where all of
  your grades will live as well. Most of the assignments will be coding
  assignments. Parts of these assignments will be manually graded, but most of
  them will be autograded. You should have received an email invitation for
  Gradescope, but if not please let us know as soon as possible (preferably via
  Ed).

- **GitHub:** Like in DSC 30, you'll _access_ all course content (lecture
  slides and assignments) by _pulling_ our course GitHub repository. That repo
  is here:
  [github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-fa](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-fa).
  In most assignments, you won't need to _push_ anything to GitHub, however in
  Projects 3 and 5 you will, and so you'll need to have an account by then.

- **Zoom (optional):** To access remote office hours, if you'd like.

Note that we will not be using Canvas for anything this quarter.

### Development Environment

As soon as you are able to, go follow the steps in the [Tech
Support](../tech_support) page of the course website to set up your development
environment for the course.

### Forms

Please fill out the [Welcome
Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGBRJrHxMPa8ix46FFDPxn9UhQoVhWOKMQ41ZTypWoj_OEAA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
to tell us a bit more about yourself and tell us if you need an alternate exam.

---

## Communication 💬

This quarter, we’ll be using Ed as our course message board. You will be added
to Ed automatically; use the invite link in the section above if you weren't
added.

If you have a question about anything to do with the course — if you’re stuck
on a problem, didn’t understand something from lecture, want clarification on
course logistics, or just have a general question about data science — you can
make a post on Ed. We only ask that if your question includes some or all of an
answer (even if you’re not sure it’s right), please make your post private so
that others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously to other students if
you prefer.

Course staff will regularly check Ed and try to answer any questions that you
have. You’re also encouraged to answer questions asked by other students.
Explaining something is a great way to solidify your understanding of it!

**Please don’t email individual staff members, just make a private or public Ed
post instead.**

---

## Course Components 🍎

### Lectures

Lectures will be held in-person on Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30-4:50PM in
[WLH 2005]. Attendance is not required, **though you are encouraged to
attend in-person if you are able to**. Lectures will be podcasted.

Lecture notebooks will be your main resource in this class. You can access
them, along with all course materials, by pulling from the course GitHub
repository,
[github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-fa](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-fa).
We will also link HTML previews of each lecture notebook from the course
homepage; you can use these to annotate the lecture notebooks with a tablet, if
you'd like.

The course textbook is called _Learning Data Science_ and is available online
via your UCSD O'Reilly library subscription or at [https://learningds.org/]().

### Discussions and Lab Reflections

Starting in Week 1, discussions will be held in-person on Friday from
10-10:50AM in [Center Hall 212]. Discussion sections will be podcasted.

You'll spend the vast majority of your time in this course on [labs](#labs) and
[projects](#projects), which you'll read more about in the sections below. The
labs you complete each week will give you hands-on practice with the tools and
techniques introduced in lectures. While completing the labs is important, it's
also important to _reflect_ on your lab work once grades are released, and
think about how you could have approached problems differently (e.g. more
efficiently).

Therefore, in discussion sections on Friday, we discuss solutions to a _subset_
of the lab that was due that Monday (4 days **before** discussion). When you
attend, you'll have a chance to discuss your implementation with course staff
and hear how others attempted the problems. Hopefully, you'll leave with a
stronger understanding of the learning objectives of the lab.

To encourage you to attend and reflect, we will offer extra credit to those who
do **all 3** of the following:

1. Submit the lab.
1. Attend discussion section in-person on Friday.
1. Satisfactorily complete a **Lab Reflection** form for the lab that was taken
   up in discussion by **Friday** at 11:59PM. The reflection form, hosted on
   Gradescope, will ask you to comment on how your answers compared to the
   solution and how you could've approached the problems differently (even if
   you received full credit on the problems that were taken up).

Since there are 8 labs, there will be 8 lab reflections and 8 discussion
sections in which we take up lab solutions. For each lab **that you submit**,
if you attend the corresponding discussion section **and** complete the lab
reflection form, you will receive 0.25% of extra credit added to your overall
grade. This can add up to 0.25% \* 8 = **2%** of extra credit for your overall
grade.

Note that:

- To earn extra credit for a particular lab, you must submit the lab, attend
  discussion, **and** complete the reflection form to receive the EC. If you
  fail to do all 3 of these things, you won't receive extra credit.
- We will be manually grading the Lab Reflection forms for completion. In order
  to receive credit, you'll need to provide meaningful responses. Simply saying
  "I could've made my code more efficient" is not enough to receive credit –
  what was suboptimal about your implementation? What benefits and drawbacks
  are there to the solutions you heard in discussion?

### Labs

There will be **9 lab assignments** due weekly throughout the quarter. Each lab
assignment will consist of a mixture of coding and free response questions.
Coding questions will ask you to fill in the body of a function. Public tests
are usually provided so that you can make sure that you\'re on the right track
(_similar to_ DSC 20), however, your submission will be graded using a private
autograder with hidden tests.

Each lab is worth the same amount, but the lowest lab will be dropped when
calculating your final score. Labs will be released on Tuesdays and due on
**Mondays** at 11:59PM.

You will access labs (and projects) by pulling the course GitHub repository.

### Projects

There will be **5 projects** due every other week throughout the quarter. Like
labs, projects consist of coding and free response questions. As their name
implies, however, projects are more open-ended and allow you to simulate
applying your data science skills in practical situations. You can think of the
projects as being mini-take-home-exams that track your _practical_ skills
throughout the quarter (whereas the exams themselves test for conceptual
understanding).

Projects are due bi-weekly. However, the week _before_ a project is due, there
will often be a _project checkpoint_. This checkpoint will ensure that you\'re
on-track to complete the project on time, and should (hopefully) be a source of
easy points.

The last project, Project 5, will be due during finals week, and can be thought
of as a practical component of the Final Exam.

Note that, unlike labs, the lowest project score is not dropped. Projects will
be released on Tuesdays and due on **Wednesday** at 11:59PM.

**Working in Pairs**

You may work together on projects (and projects only!) with a partner. If you
work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts
of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time
together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to
follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer
and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high
level.

In particular, you **cannot** split up the project and each work on separate
parts independently.

If you work with a partner:

- Only one partner needs to submit the project on Gradescope; this partner
  should add the other partner to their submission.
- You must also submit the checkpoint together.
- You and your partner will receive the same score on any submissions you make
  together.

If you are unhappy with your partnership (e.g., if your partner does not keep
in touch, does not come prepared to work on the assignment, or does not seem to
be engaged in the process), please first address your concerns to your partner,
and try to agree on what should be done to make the partnership work well for
both of you. If that approach is not successful, explain the issues to the
instructors, who will work with you and your partner to improve the situation.

You may use different partners on different projects.

**Note that you may not work with partners on lab assignments, however you're
encouraged to discuss all assignments with others at a conceptual level in
office hours and study groups.**

### Office Hours

To get help on assignments and concepts, course staff will be hosting several
office hours per week. The majority of our office hours are held in-person,
though a few are held remotely – **if you're able to, you're strongly
encouraged to attend in-person**. See the [Calendar](../calendar) tab of the
course website for the most up-to-date schedule and instructions.

### Weekly Schedule

To summarize all of the events and deadlines, refer to this general weekly
schedule (which is subject to change in any given week):

| Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday     | Saturday |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
|        |        | Lecture |           | Lecture  |            |          |

## Exams 📝

This class has one Midterm Exam and one Final Exam. Exams are cumulative,
though the Final Exam will emphasize material after the Midterm Exam.

- **Midterm Exam**: Thursday, November 2nd, 3:30-4:50PM, WLH 2005
  (during lecture)

- **Final Exam:** Monday, December 11th, 3:00-6:00PM, location TBD

**Both exams will be administered in-person**. If you have conflicts with
either of the exams, please let us know on the [Welcome
Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGBRJrHxMPa8ix46FFDPxn9UhQoVhWOKMQ41ZTypWoj_OEAA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Redemption Policy

The Final Exam will consist of two parts: a “Midterm” section and a
“post-Midterm” section. If you do better on the “Midterm” section of the Final
Exam than you did on the original Midterm Exam, your score on the “Midterm”
section will replace your original Midterm Exam score. This lowers the stakes
of the Midterm Exam and gives you two opportunities to demonstrate your
understanding of the content from the first half of the course. This also means
that you can miss the Midterm Exam for any reason and have the score be
replaced by your score on the “Midterm” section of the Final Exam (though we do
not recommend this).

**You must take the Final Exam to pass the course.**

## Policies 💯

### Grading

Here is how we'll compute your grade:

| Component                               | Weight              | Notes                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Labs                                    | 30%                 | 3.75% per lab, lowest dropped   |
| Projects                                | 35%                 | 7% per project, no drops        |
| Project Checkpoints                     | 5%                  | 1% per project, no drops\*      |
| Midterm Exam                            | 10%                 | see the Redemption Policy above |
| Final Exam                              | 20%                 |                                 |
| Discussion Attendance + Lab Reflections | 2% (extra credit)   | 0.25% per reflection            |

\*Since Projects 3 and 5 do not have checkpoints, everyone who submits Projects
3 and 5 will automatically receive the 1% checkpoint credit.

### Late Policy, Slip Days, and Drops

All assignments must be submitted by 11:59PM San Diego time on the due date to
be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before
the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it’s a
good habit to submit early and often. If you make a submission after the
deadline, your assignment will be counted as late.

You have **6 "slip days"** to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends
the deadline of an assignment by 24 hours. The number of slip days you can use
on an assignment depends on the kind of assignment:

- On labs, you may use up to 1 slip day. Labs will not be accepted more than 24
  hours after the deadline.
- On projects and project checkpoints, you may use up to 2 slip days. These
  assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the deadline. Note
  that you will not be able to use slip days on Project 5.
- You may not use slip days on lab reflection assignments. These assignments
  will not be accepted after the original deadline.

Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency
in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an
assignment on its original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slip days
are also meant for things like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you
go to submit your assignment. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional
circumstances, so **you probably should not need to use all 6, but if you have
something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your
classwork on time, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can work
something out**.

**Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, and you don’t
need to ask in order to use one.** It’s your responsibility to keep track of
how many you have left. If you’ve run out of slip days and submit an assignment
late, that assignment may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when
we calculate grades at the end of the quarter. However, in the event that you
use all 6 days and submit another assignment late, we will allocate your slip
days first to your projects (in chronological order), then to your labs (in
chronological order), and then to other assignments. This is done to prevent
you from receiving a 0 on, say, Project 4, if you've used all of your slip days
on labs up until that point; in such a case, you’d instead receive a 0 on an
earlier lab that isn’t weighted as much in your grade.

### Regrade Requests

Most of the labs and projects are autograded, but some questions are manually
graded. If you feel that there in an error in the autograder or that the manual
grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request within **three
days** of the grades being released. If you do not submit a regrade request
within three days, your original grade will be final.

**Regrade Requests for Manually Graded Problems**

To submit a regrade request for a manually graded problem, make the regrade
request directly on Gradescope. Note that part of your grade is clarity, so if
your answer was mostly right but unclear you may still not be eligible for full
credit.

**Regrade Requests for Autograded Problems**

To submit an autograder regrade request, please fill out the [Autograder
Regrade Request Form](https://forms.gle/HmKyzJ7rEoUCM4mb8).

The autograder is very picky: it expects your assignments to have exactly the
correct file names, all functions must be named correctly, etc. If these are
wrong, your code may not run and the autograder may assign zero points. This is
a **grading catastrophe 😧**.

Grading catastrophes are preventable! After submitting your assignment, always
wait around to see the output of the Gradescope grader and ensure that it runs
properly. Also, be sure to submit your assignment (or at least part of it) to
Gradescope with enough time before the deadline to get help if there is a
strange autograder problem.

In the case that you submit code that doesn't run and discover this at a later
date, you have some options:

1.  If it is still before the late deadline, you may use slip days to fix your
    code and re-submit. Note that you're free to do this even if your code runs
    – this is just making use of the normal slip day mechanism to submit an
    assignment late.
2.  If it is past the late deadline **and** your code requires only minor fixes
    (e.g., the file name is wrong) we will fix your code at the cost of **2**
    slip days. Note that these slip days are in addition to any slip days you
    already used on the assignment. You can submit a catastrophe regrade
    request the same way you submit a regular autograder regrade request, by
    filling out the [Autograder Regrade Request
    Form](https://forms.gle/HmKyzJ7rEoUCM4mb8).

### Incompletes

In the unfortunate circumstance that you become sick, suffer a loss, or
otherwise experience a significant setback that is outside of your control, you
may be eligible for an Incomplete grade, which allows you to complete the rest
of the work at a later time. If you are experiencing challenges due to
circumstances outside your control, please contact me ASAP and we can discuss
the best course of action. Note that an Incomplete does not allow you to re-do
work that has already been completed, only to do work that hasn’t been
completed, so it’s best to reach out right away.

### A note on letter grades

_The following is adapted from [CSE
160](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse160/20au/syllabus/index.html#curve)
at the University of Washington._

Grading for this class is not curved in the sense that the average is set at
(say) a B+ and half of the class must receive a grade lower than that. If
everyone does well and shows mastery of the material, everyone can receive an A
(this would be awesome!). If no one does well (this is unlikely), then everyone
can receive a C.

Grading for this class is curved in the sense that we do not have a pre-defined
mapping from project and exam scores to a final GPA. There is no pre-determined
score (e.g., 90% of all possible points) that earns an A or a B or a C or any
other grade. To determine the final grade, we will ask questions like “Did this
student master the material?”. With that said, grades will not be any stricter
than the standard grading scale (where an A+ is a 97+, A is 93+, A- is 90+,
etc). For instance, the threshold for an “A” will never be higher than 93%.

Try your best not to worry about grades, and we’ll reciprocate by being fair.
We’re in this together 😎.

## Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity 🤝

DSC 80 is known for being a rigorous but rewarding course. While you will be
challenged this quarter, we will be offering you plenty of support through
office hours and Ed. Make good use of these resources, and you will be able to
succeed in this course.

There is no excuse for cheating in this course. If you do cheat, we will
enforce the [UCSD Policy on Integrity of
Scholarship](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2).
This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will
put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that
by taking this course, their assignments may be submitted to third-party
software to help detect plagiarism.

### Why is academic integrity important?

Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus.
When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for
someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their
academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades
(and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This
devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for
the the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are
honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be
proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD!

The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the
standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your
good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot
list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic
integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations.

### What counts as cheating?

In DSC 80, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC
80 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete
your assignments. However, all code must be written by you (or, in the instance
of projects, together with your partner).

The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed in DSC 80
(not an exhaustive list):

- Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except from your pair
  programming partner during projects), the web, or any other resource not
  officially sanctioned by this course
- Posting your code online, including on Ed, unless privately to instructors
  only
- Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf
- Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else
- Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the
  course
- Splitting up project questions with your pair programming partner and each
  working on different questions
- Collaborating with others on exams

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are
allowed in DSC 80 (not an exhaustive list):

- **(new) Using AI code generation tools, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT,
  to help write your code**
- Discussing the general approach to solving labs or projects
- Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you
  solved them
- Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken
  the exam after the exam is complete
- Using code provided in class, by the textbook or any other assigned reading
  or video, with attribution
- Google searching for documentation on Python or `pandas`
- Working together with other students on assignments without copying or
  sharing answers
- Posting a question about your approach to a problem on Ed, without sharing
  your code

### How can I be sure that my actions are NOT considered cheating?

The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgement and remembering
to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage.
Here are some suggestions for completing your work:

- Don't look at or discuss the details of another student's code for an
  assignment you are working on, and don't let another student look at your
  code.
- Don't start with someone else's code and make changes to it, or in any way
  share code with other students.
- If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don't take notes,
  and wait an hour afterward before you write any code.

## Support 🫂

### Accommodations

From the [Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)](https://osd.ucsd.edu/):

> OSD works with students with documented disabilities to review documentation
> and determine reasonable accommodations. Disabilities can occur in these
> areas: psychological, psychiatric, learning, attention, chronic health,
> physical, vision, hearing, and acquired brain injuries, and may occur at any
> time during a student’s college career. We encourage you to contact the OSD
> as soon as you become aware of a condition that is disabling so that we can
> work with you.

If you already have accommodations via OSD, please make sure that we receive
your Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter by the end of Week 1 so that
we can make arrangements for accommodations. Share your AFA letter with the
instructor and the Data Science OSD Liaison, who can be reached at
dscstudent@ucsd.edu.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our
diversity of perspectives, experiences, and identities. Our goal is to create a
diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable
and can thrive. If you have any suggestions as to how we could create a more
inclusive setting, please let us know. We also expect that you, as a student in
this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the [UCSD
Principles of
Community](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fucsd.edu%2Fabout%2Fprinciples.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE1YPiUyffLg0kI10zLtUQl6iCDmQ).
Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be
different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is
respected and feels comfortable.

### Campus Resources

If there is an issue you feel uncomfortable speaking with us or are searching
for help on a specific concern, there are several campus resources available to
you, including:

- [UCSD Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://caps.ucsd.edu/)
- [Hub Basic Needs Center](https://thehub.ucsd.edu/)
