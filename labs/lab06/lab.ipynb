    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the sixth DSC 80 lab this quarter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-wi).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ensure that all of the work you want to submit is in `lab.py`, we've included a script named `lab-validation.py` in the lab folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."

    "\n",
    "In Question 2, you'll spend plenty of time parsing HTML source code.

This exercise will help you better understand how the code in a `.html` file is structured.\n",

    "- You can write and view basic HTML with a Jupyter Notebook, using either a Markdown cell or by using the `IPython.display.HTML` function (which takes in a string of HTML and renders it).\n",
    "- If you write your HTML code within a Jupyter Notebook, you should later copy your code into a text editor and save it with the `.html` extension. You could also write your HTML in a text editor directly.\n",

    "- Close: The price of a stock at the end of a trading day.\n",
    "- Volume: The total number of shares traded in a day.\n",
    "- Percent change: The difference in price with respect to the original price, as a percentage.\n",

    "To make requests to the aforementioned API, you will need an API key. In order to get one, you will need to make an account at the website. Once you've signed up, you can use the API key that comes with the free plan. It has a limit of 250 requests per day, which should be more than enough.

    "1. The URL to make requests to is `'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{}.json'`, however, the `{}` should be replaced with the ID of the article or page you are trying to access. \n",
    "2. Again, do not `import json` – instead, use the `json` method on the Response object you get back.\n",
    "3. Use depth-first search when traversing the comments tree. You will have to do this manually, since you cannot use Beautiful Soup (which is only for HTML documents, not JSON objects).\n",
    "4. Make sure the length of your returned DataFrame is the same as value for the `'descendants'` key in the response JSON (both of which correspond to the number of comments for the story).\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use loops in this function. You may also want to create at least one helper function.\n",
