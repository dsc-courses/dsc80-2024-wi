    "Welcome to the ninth and final DSC 80 lab this quarter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2024-wi).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ensure that all of the work you want to submit is in `lab.py`, we've included a script named `lab-validation.py` in the lab folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."

    "- The `StdScalerByGroup` transformer works on an input array/DataFrame `X` whose first column contains groups, and whose remaining columns are quantitative and need to be standardized (within each group).\n",
    "- The `fit` method should determine the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative column within each group in the input data `X` and save them in the instance variable `grps_`. (For instance, one of the quantities you may calculate here is the standard deviation of `'c1'`, but only for the rows whose `'group'` is `'B'`.)\n",

    "If you `fit` and `transform` a `StdScalerByGroup` transformer on the `toy` DataFrame (without the `'y'` column), you should get back a DataFrame with two columns, `'c1'` and `'c2'`, with groups stored in the index (if you end up creating a `MultiIndex`, that is fine).\n",

    "Predicting whether or not passengers on the Titanic survived is a common first assignment when learning about classification – now it's your turn!\n",

    "Complete the implementation of the function `titanic_model`, which takes in a DataFrame `titanic` containing **training data only** and returns a `Pipeline` object fit to the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You have freedom to build your own model. That is, **you can use any classification algorithm**, but your model should satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is built on the (binary) response column `'Survived'`.\n",
    "* The model uses features derived from **all other columns in `titanic`**. Below, we specify which columns to \"engineer\"; you may \"engineer\" features using other columns, but be sure to include every column in your model (even if you choose to leave some columns as-is).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Required feature engineering:\n",
    "    * Derive a feature from the \"title\" in the `'Name'` field (e.g. \"Mr\", \"Miss\", \"Mrs\" – the names themselves should not be used as a feature; think about why).\n",
    "    * Derive a feature that standardizes passengers' ages among their `'Pclass'` (use Question 3!).\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "    \n",
    "Your model must achieve an accuracy of 0.78 on both the training set and the test set. Note that while you have access to the test set, it is still encouraged to perform your own model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra credit: If your model can consistently earn an accuracy of above 0.83 on the test set, you can earn 5 points of extra credit on the lab!** That is, you can earn up to 60 points on the lab, even though it is only graded out of 55 points (meaning you _can_ have a score above 100% on the lab).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Pipeline` objects can have other `Pipeline` objects within them. While this isn't a requirement, you may find this useful to break down your model into smaller, more manageable steps.\n",
    "    - You can even create a `Pipeline` made up of transformers only, if you want to perform multiple transformations on a single column. We did this in [Lecture 15](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec15/lec15.html#Standardization).\n",
    "    - The function `make_pipeline` from [Lecture 15](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec15/lec15.html#%F0%9F%92%A1-Pro-Tip:-Using-make_pipeline) could also be useful.\n",
    "- Your submitted `titanic_model` function should have the model's hyperparameters (e.g. tree depth) hard-coded in it. That is, the `Pipeline` object doesn't have to include the hyperparameter selection process.\n",
    "- You will find the [`FunctionTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer.html) class useful. If you want your transformer to output a categorical feature, you may need to specify `validate=False`.\n",
    "- When using the [`ColumnTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer) class , you may find the `remainder` keyword helpful.\n",
    "- If you are set out to get those extra 5 points, consider building some meaningful features before fine-tuning the hyperparameters of your model. Do an EDA on the dataset – what kinds of people are more prone to survive?"
